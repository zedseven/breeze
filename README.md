# `breeze`
[![License: MIT/Apache-2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT%2FApache--2.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE-MIT)

A tool for running presentations. Effectively a spiritual fork of the `suckless` tool,
[`sent`](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/).

`sent` is great, but often in work environments, Windows is predominant. `breeze` is a tool that supports
the `sent` presentation format, but runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux (pretty much anywhere that Rust code
can be run).

Note that the goal here isn't for perfect 1:1 parity with `sent`. The goal is to have an easy-to-use, simple,
cross-platform tool that supports the same format.

If a feature is missing or core behaviour is drastically different, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/zedseven/breeze/issues).
